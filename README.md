Assignment 3: Style a Webpage Using a Style Guide

I had trouble with deciding when it was appropriate to use Bootstrap positioning versus LESS. I eneded up using Bootstrap for positioning most of the time and LESS for everything else. I also had somethingweird happen with github where some changes were lost and I had to redo them. Finally, my site has some visual problems at the largest size that I couldn't find an answer to. 

For help, I used Stack Overflow, W3Schools, Bootstrap documentation, and GitHub Documentation.
